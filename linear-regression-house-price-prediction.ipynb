In practice, you can uses these rules more as rules of thumb when using Ordinary Least Squares Regression, the most common implementation of linear regression.\n\n> Try different preparations of your data using these heuristics and see what works best for your problem.\n- **Linear Assumption.** Linear regression assumes that the relationship between your input and output is linear. It does not support anything else. This may be obvious, but it is good to remember when you have a lot of attributes. You may need to transform data to make the relationship linear (e.g. log transform for an exponential relationship).\n- **Remove Noise.** Linear regression assumes that your input and output variables are not noisy. Consider using data cleaning operations that let you better expose and clarify the signal in your data. This is most important for the output variable and you want to remove outliers in the output variable (y) if possible.\n- **Remove Collinearity.** Linear regression will over-fit your data when you have highly correlated input variables. Consider calculating pairwise correlations for your input data and removing the most correlated.\n- **Gaussian Distributions.** Linear regression will make more reliable predictions if your input and output variables have a Gaussian distribution.

📝 Summary\nIn this notebook you discovered the linear regression algorithm for machine learning.\n\nYou covered a lot of ground including:\n> - The common linear regression models (Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, ...).\n> - The representation used by the model.\n> - Learning algorithms used to estimate the coefficients in the model.\n> - Rules of thumb to consider when preparing data for use with linear regression.\n> - How to evaluate a linear regression model.\n\n\n# 🔗 References:\n- [Scikit-learn library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning)\n-
